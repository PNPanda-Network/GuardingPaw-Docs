3. On the upper-right-corner, you can select your server by clicking on **Select a server** and selecting the server you want to add the bot to and manage.
4. (Optional) You can manage all things via [Commands](all-commands.md), but the control panel is more user-friendly.




Click through the various pages and explore a little to see what the bot offers. If you need help read around in the control panel, the docs. If you still need help, you can visit our support server.
