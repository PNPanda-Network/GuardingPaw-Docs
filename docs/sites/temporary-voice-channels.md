# Temporary Voice Channels

Create dynamic voice channels that automatically appear when needed and disappear when empty. Perfect for communities that need flexible voice communication without cluttering the server with unused channels.

## How It Works

Temporary voice channels provide an elegant solution to voice channel management:

1. **Join the Master Channel**: Users join a designated "create channel"
2. **Automatic Creation**: A new temporary voice channel is instantly created
3. **User Gets Moved**: The user is automatically moved to their new channel
4. **Channel Ownership**: The creator gets manage permissions for their channel
5. **Auto Cleanup**: When the last user leaves, the channel is automatically deleted

**Default Channel Name Pattern**: `Talk #<ID>` (where ID is a unique number)
